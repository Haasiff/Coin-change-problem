The Coin Change Problem is a well-known algorithmic problem that involves determining the minimum number of coins (or currency denominations) required to make a given amount of money. This problem is commonly used in the field of computer science and algorithms, and it has various real-world applications, such as making change at a cash register or optimizing the use of a limited supply of coins or bills in vending machines.
Denominations: The set of coin denominations available for making change. Each denomination has a value, such as 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, etc.

Target Amount: The amount of money for which you want to make change. In the example above, the target amount is 30 cents.

Objective: Find the minimum number of coins required to make up the target amount using the available denominations.

Example:

Let's consider an example with coin denominations [1, 5, 10, 25] and a target amount of 30 cents. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make 30 cents.

One possible optimal solution is to use one 25-cent coin and one 5-cent coin, totaling 30 cents. This requires a minimum of 2 coins.
Approaches:

Greedy Algorithm: The greedy approach involves selecting the largest denomination coins first to make up the target amount. While this approach often works for standard coin systems like the U.S. coin system, it may not always find the optimal solution for arbitrary coin denominations.

Dynamic Programming: Dynamic programming is a more general and reliable approach to solve the Coin Change Problem. It involves creating a table or array to store intermediate results for various subproblems, making it possible to find the minimum number of coins for increasing amounts.

Dynamic Programming Steps:

Create an array dp of size (target_amount + 1) to store the minimum number of coins required for each amount from 0 to the target amount.

Initialize dp[0] to 0 (because no coins are needed to make 0 cents).

For each coin denomination, iterate through the dp array, updating the minimum number of coins required for each amount.

The final value in dp[target_amount] will represent the minimum number of coins required to make the target amount.
The minCoins function returns the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount using the given coin denominations.

The Coin Change Problem, especially when solved using dynamic programming, is a classic example of a problem-solving technique that has numerous applications in real-world scenarios where optimal resource allocation is crucial.
